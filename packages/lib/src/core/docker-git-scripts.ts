// CHANGE: define the set of docker-git scripts to embed in generated containers
// WHY: scripts (session-backup, pre-commit guards, knowledge splitter) must be available
//      inside containers for git hooks and docker-git module usage
// REF: issue-176
// SOURCE: n/a
// FORMAT THEOREM: ∀ name ∈ dockerGitScriptNames: name ∈ scripts/ ∧ referenced_by_hooks(name)
// PURITY: CORE (pure constant definition)
// INVARIANT: list is exhaustive for all scripts referenced by generated git hooks
// COMPLEXITY: O(1)

/**
 * Names of docker-git scripts that must be available inside generated containers.
 *
 * These scripts are referenced by git hooks (pre-push, pre-commit) and session
 * backup workflows. They are copied into each project's build context under
 * `scripts/` and embedded into the Docker image at `/opt/docker-git/scripts/`.
 *
 * @pure true
 * @invariant ∀ name ∈ result: ∃ file(scripts/{name}) in docker-git workspace
